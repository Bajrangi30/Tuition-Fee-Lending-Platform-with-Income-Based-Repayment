## Project Title
Tuition Fee Lending Platform with Income-Based Repayment

## Project Description
The Tuition Fee Lending Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows students to borrow money for their tuition fees and repay it based on their future income. This system ensures that students repay their loans in proportion to their income after graduation, offering a flexible and fair approach to loan repayment. 

Using a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, this project creates a transparent and immutable ledger of tuition loans, which can be easily accessed by students, educational institutions, and other stakeholders. The contract ensures that loans are issued based on certain criteria, repayments are tracked, and the loan status is always visible to the participants.

The core feature of the platform is the income-based repayment system. Students only begin repayments when their income meets a specified threshold, and they repay a fixed percentage of their income until the loan is fully paid.

## Project Vision
The vision of the **Tuition Fee Lending Platform** is to create a more equitable and flexible way for students to finance their education. Traditional student loans often put an undue burden on students who may not have sufficient income to meet fixed repayment schedules immediately after graduation. By using an income-based repayment model, this project aims to:

- **Reduce Financial Burden**: Repayments are tied to the student's income, making them more manageable.
- **Provide Transparency**: The blockchain ensures full transparency regarding loan issuance, repayments, and outstanding balances.
- **Promote Fairness**: Loan repayment is tied to actual financial ability, ensuring that students who are struggling financially are not overburdened.
- **Decentralize Education Financing**: Create a decentralized platform where educational institutions, lenders, and students interact directly, without intermediaries.

## Key Features

- **Income-Based Repayment**: Repayments are calculated as a percentage of the student's income, ensuring they are always affordable. The repayment amount is dynamically adjusted based on income.
- **Loan Issuance**: Educational institutions or lending bodies can issue loans to students who need tuition financing.
- **Loan Status Tracking**: Students and other stakeholders can easily track the status of the loan, including the total amount repaid, remaining balance, and whether the loan has been fully repaid.
- **No Fixed Monthly Payments**: Unlike traditional loans, the platform allows repayments to be tied to income, which is particularly useful for students just entering the workforce.
- **Transparent Loan Management**: All loan details (amount, repayment percentage, income threshold, and status) are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring full transparency.
- **Flexible Repayment Start**: Repayment only begins when the student's income reaches a pre-set threshold, providing a safety net for those still in low-paying entry-level jobs.
- **Security and Immutability**: Being deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, the smart contract ensures that loan terms, repayments, and balances are secure and cannot be altered by any party.
- **Loan Full Repayment Notification**: Students receive a notification (through an event) when their loan has been fully repaid, and the contract updates the loan status accordingly.
